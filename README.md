# Machine Learning Projects

## Cat vs Dog Image Classifier
- Description:  Built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the classifier can recognize complex patterns and visual features to make predictions. Trained on a vast dataset of labeled cat and dog images. Use of VGG3 Model resulted to 70% accuracy on test data.
- Applied Concepts: Image Processing, Data Augmentation,  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - VGG Model, Model Evaluation
- Tools and Libraries: Google Colab, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Book Recommendation Engine
- Description: Implemented using K-NearestNeighbors, an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data based on its features. In this case, the book titles are grouped based on the user ratings. Evaluation will return 5 nearest books to the given book based on the groupings
- Applied Concepts: Data Collection and Cleaning, K-NearestNeighbors, Model Evaluation
- Tools and Libraries: Google Colab, scikit-learn , NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Health Insurance Cost Predictor
- Description:  Modeled by using linear regression to estimate healthcare costs based on demographic data and lifestyle factors (age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region).
- Applied Concepts: Data Collection and Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Linear Regression, Model Evaluation, Data Visualization
- Tools and Libraries: Google Colab, TensorFlow , NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## SMS Spam Classifier
- Description:  Developed a machine learning model (CNN) to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam.
- Applied Concepts: Data Collection and Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Model Evaluation
- Tools and Libraries: Google Colab, TensorFlow , NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

- Link: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jharviy/fcc_machinelearning/blob/main/sms_spam_classification.ipynb)

## Rock Paper Scissors - AI
- Description: Developed an AI player for the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. The AI Player will be able to use multiple strategies and switch to a different one if current strategy has low winrate. One strategy includes Markov Chains that utilizes probabilities to determine patterns from previous plays. Able to achieve atleast 70% winrate in 1000 games tested on different kinds of players.
- Applied Concepts: Decision Making, Error Handling, Game Logic, Probability and Statistics, Markov Chains Algorithm
- Tools and Libraries: replit, Numpy
